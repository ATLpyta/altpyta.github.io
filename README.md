# ATLpyta

The main purpose of **ATLpyta** (**p**ick **y**ou **t**ransform**a**tions) is to allow ATL users to select Model Transformations for their experiment among the transformations of the ATL zoo.

Model Transformations are compared according to the following metrics: #rules, #matched rules, #lazy rules, #inherited rules, #helpers, #helpers with context and depth of rules inheritance tree ). Users have access to all comparison data and to a user-friendly data visualisation.

Once a set of model transformations is selected (manually or automatically), you can download the corresponding source files.
