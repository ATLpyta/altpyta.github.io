# ATLpyta

The main purpose of **ATLpyta** (**p**ick **y**ou **t**ransform**a**tions) is to allow ATL users to select Model Transformations for their experiment among the transformations of the ATL zoo.

Model Transformations are compared according to some metrics (#rules, helpers, ...). Users have access to all comparison data and to a user-friendly data visualisation. 

[Use ATLpyta](https://atlpyta.github.io/)
