# ATLpyta

The main purpose of **ATLpyta** (**p**ick **y**ou **t**ransform**a**tions) is to allow ATL users to select Model Transformations for their experiment among the transformations of the ATL zoo.

Model Transformations are compared according to the following metrics: #rules, #matched rules, #lazy rules, #inherited rules, #helpers, #helpers with context and depth of rules inheritance tree ). Users have access to all comparison data and to a user-friendly data visualisation.

Once a set of model transformations is selected (manually or automatically), you can download the corresponding source files. 


## How to use ATLpyta

**ATLpyta** is a web application. You can quickly use all the features by simply visiting the web site: [ATLpyta web site](https://atlpyta.github.io/).

The next sections describe the **4** main features of the tool.

## Explore the zoo

Here you are allowed to explore the *105* model transformations of the zoo. The MTs are viewed as a list.

You can expand each item of this list to view the details about the corresponding MT. This consist of two different views for the metrics: gross and graphical. Moreover, you can download the source files and the 2 different views of the metrics.

For more convenience, there are 3 different modes for sorting the model transformations while exploring the zoo: by name, by #rules or by #helpers.

## graphical comparison

[Kiviat diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_chart) (also called radar charts or spider web charts) are used to graphically compare the model transformations according the previous metrics.

First, the user selects a list of model transformation. Then the tool generates an interractive Kiviat chart comparing the chosen MTs.
